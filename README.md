INTRODUCTION
------------
For this homework assignment, we developed detailed step by step instructions for 

 1) Containerizing the web application developed in homework 1 and deploying it locally
 2) Deploying the containerized application on Kubernetes using Rancher
 3) Extra Credit - Establishing a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub and Jenkins

Our steps are thoroughly documented in the included PDF with heavy use of screenshots to make them easy to follow.

We also developed a video that follows the instructional steps and demonstrates the work.
